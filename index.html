<!-- WHY -->
<section id="why" class="why">
  <div class="container why-layout">
    <div class="why-text">
      <h2>Why I do this</h2>

      <p class="section-intro">
        I began my career in scientific research because I wanted my work to make a tangible difference —
        especially for patients. What I didn’t anticipate was how often strong science struggled to move
        beyond the lab.
      </p>

      <h3>When science stalls</h3>
      <p>
        Again and again, I saw promising research slow down not because it lacked rigor, but because the
        path from discovery to decision-making was unclear. That gap became even more visible when I
        started working in the pharmaceutical industry.
      </p>

      <h3>Why I stepped outside the lab</h3>
      <p>
        I didn’t pursue an MBA because I wanted to leave science. I did it because I believed the scientific
        world — and especially science-driven industries — needed stronger bridges between evidence,
        strategy, and execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to understand how decisions are shaped under uncertainty, how trade-offs are made, and
        how scientific insight can be framed in a way that supports real accountability without losing
        nuance or rigor. That perspective fundamentally reshaped how I work.
      </p>

      <h3>What I learned in pharma</h3>
      <p>
        Working in pharma exposed me to the realities of translating science into business decisions at
        scale. I saw how complex scientific insight had to compete with timelines, incentives, legacy
        structures, and internal politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decisions were sometimes made with limited scientific grounding — not out of disregard, but
        because the interfaces between science and business were weak. For scientists, this was
        frustrating. For business leaders, it was overwhelming. And for patients, it often meant delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, it became clear to me that many of these challenges weren’t about intent or capability.
        They were about misalignment between scientific depth and strategic direction.
      </p>

      <h3>What I focus on today</h3>
      <p>
        Today, my work sits at the intersection of science, AI, and decision-making. I help organizations —
        particularly in pharma and other research-intensive industries — translate complex scientific and
        technological insight into clear, defensible decisions.
      </p>

      <ul class="why-list">
        <li>Making uncertainty explicit rather than implicit</li>
        <li>Strengthening scientific understanding where it informs strategy</li>
        <li>Separating evidence from advocacy and internal politics</li>
        <li>Aligning researchers and leaders around the same decision framework</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When this translation is done well, progress accelerates. Conversations improve. And promising
        science has a much clearer path to real-world impact.
      </p>

      <h3>What drives me</h3>
      <p>
        I do this work because I’ve seen how much value is lost when scientific excellence isn’t matched
        with decision clarity. And I’ve seen how much becomes possible when those worlds are deliberately
        connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Better decisions don’t just move organizations forward. They are how innovation reaches patients.
